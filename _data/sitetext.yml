    text: "Hi there! 

My name is Jenn Edobi and I am the founder of Edobi Fitness! A little bit about myself before I get the chance to hopefully meet you someday. I am 25 years old and currently located in Union, NJ. I began running as early as 7 years old and went on to run track at Union highschool, Vanderbilt University and then professionally for Team Nigeria! Although, I don’t compete any longer, I’m still passionate about challenging myself physically and mentally and passing on the skills and knowledge I’ve attained as a track athlete over the years to help others achieve their fitness goals."
